# How to Cite This Work

If you use my D²TL model, experiments, code, or data, I would appreciate a citation.

**BibTeX** (see `CITATION.bib` in this folder):

```bibtex
@misc{nokko-d2tl-2026,
  author       = {NOK KO},
  title        = {D²TL: Physics-Aware Dual-Path RSU Coverage Prediction for 6G V2I},
  year         = {2026},
  howpublished = {GitHub repository: Model 3 (Coverage Mamba-3), Paper Models Suite},
  note         = {Dual-path system: MLP primary + Mamba-3 physics backup; Selector Brain orchestrator; 7 experiments; Streamlit dashboard; full training and experiment data.},
}
```

**Plain text:**

NOK KO. D²TL: Physics-Aware Dual-Path RSU Coverage Prediction for 6G V2I. 2026. Model 3 (Coverage Mamba-3). Dual-path system: MLP primary + Mamba-3 physics backup; Selector Brain orchestrator; seven experiments; Streamlit dashboard; full training and experiment data.

I release this repository for research and reproduction. If you adapt the architecture or use the experiment protocol in your own work, please acknowledge the source.
